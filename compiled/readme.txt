    0.63 (2 September 2026)
      sound_off now mutes every chip declared in the VGM header
      (chips_mask), not only the chip shown in the "Chip:" line:
      multi-chip files (e.g. Robocop, YM2203+YM3812) no longer
      leave a hanging note after quitting the player.
      YM2203 fix for FPGA implementations that use the canonical
      chip-select values on port #FFFD: VGM commands 0x55/0xA5
      now emit the canonical select first ($FB = chip 1,
      $FA = chip 2; f=0 un-gates the FM part / clears FM_DIS)
      followed by the plugin-style select (#F0/#F1), so
      2xYM2203 files address both chips correctly on either
      kind of hardware. $FB is also written once before playback
      of a YM2203 file starts, and the mute routine writes the
      canonical selects $FB/$FA before silencing each chip.
      Hardware and emulators that only understand #F0/#F1 still
      get those selects last and are unaffected (note: the
      meaning of bit 0 in the canonical selects is opposite to
      the plugin-style ones).
      YM2203 clock conversion: arcade VGM rips are logged for a
      different chip clock (e.g. 1943 - 1.5 MHz) and used to
      play about 15 semitones too high on TSFM (~3.55 MHz).
      When the YM2203 clock in the VGM header differs from the
      TSFM clock by more than ~3%, FM F-num/block values and SSG
      tone/noise/envelope periods are rescaled on the fly by the
      clock ratio, so such rips play at their original pitch.
      Native TSFM rips (3.5/3.58 MHz) are passed through
      untouched.
      The same clock conversion is applied to AY-3-8910 rips
      logged for a non-ZX clock (header offset 0x74): Amstrad
      CPC 1 MHz (about +10 semitones on ZX), Atari ST 2 MHz,
      Vectrex 1.5 MHz now play at their original pitch;
      ZX/Pentagon/MSX-clock rips (within ~3% of 1.7734 MHz) are
      passed through untouched.
      The plugin now uses RAM up to #9BFF (frequency scaling
      tables and the file buffer moved to #9300-#9BFF).
      Progress bar fix: the bar advanced only when the block
      counter was exactly equal to the next threshold, so if
      more than one 512-byte block was read between two waits
      (e.g. a long register-init sequence at the start of an
      OPL file) the threshold was skipped and the bar stayed on
      its first cell for the whole track. It now advances when
      the counter reaches or passes the threshold, and is drawn
      to the end when the track finishes.
      End of track no longer cut: many rips end right after the
      key-off of the last notes, and the player silenced the
      chip immediately, cutting the release of those notes.
      After the end of a non-looping track the chip now keeps
      sounding for ~2 seconds before being muted (Space/Q
      skip it); tracks with a loop point are muted at once.
