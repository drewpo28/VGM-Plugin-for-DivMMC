# VGM-Plugin-for-DivMMC
VGM Player is a simple plugin for the NMI browser (ESXDOS) that allows playback of VGM audio files on ZX Spectrum-compatible hardware. Supported sound chips: AY-3-8910, YMF262 (OPL3), YM3812 (OPL2), YM2203 / 2x YM2203 (TSFM), YM2413 (OPLL), SAA1099 / 2x SAA1099, SN76489 / 2x SN76489

Current version: 0.63

Changes:
- 0.63: progress bar fix — it only moved when the block counter hit the next threshold exactly; when more than one 512-byte block was read between waits (e.g. a long init sequence at the start of an OPL file) the threshold was skipped and the bar stayed on the first cell. Now it advances on "reached or passed" and is filled to the end when the track finishes
- 0.63: the end of a track is no longer cut — the chip was muted right at the end-of-data command, cutting the release of the last notes (many rips end right after the final key-off). Non-looping tracks now keep sounding for ~2 s before muting (Space/Q skip it); looping tracks are muted at once
- 0.63: sound_off mutes every chip declared in the VGM header (chips_mask), not only the one shown in "Chip:" — multi-chip files (e.g. Robocop, YM2203+YM3812) no longer leave a hanging note after exit
- 0.63: YM2203 on FPGA implementations that use the canonical chip-select values on port #FFFD — VGM commands 0x55/0xA5 now emit the canonical select first ($FB = chip 1, $FA = chip 2; f=0 un-gates the FM part / clears FM_DIS) followed by the plugin-style select (#F0/#F1, note the opposite meaning of bit 0), so 2xYM2203 files address both chips correctly on either kind of hardware; $FB is also written once before playback starts and the mute routine writes $FB/$FA before silencing each chip
- 0.63: YM2203 clock conversion — arcade VGM rips are logged for a different chip clock (e.g. 1943: 1.5 MHz) and used to play ~15 semitones too high on TSFM (~3.55 MHz). When the header clock differs from the TSFM clock by more than ~3%, FM F-num/block values and SSG tone/noise/envelope periods are now rescaled on the fly by the clock ratio, so such rips play at their original pitch. Native TSFM rips (3.5/3.58 MHz) are passed through untouched
- 0.63: the same clock conversion for AY-3-8910 — rips logged for a non-ZX AY clock (Amstrad CPC 1 MHz ≈ +10 semitones, Atari ST 2 MHz, Vectrex 1.5 MHz) now play at their original pitch; ZX/Pentagon/MSX-clock rips (within ~3% of 1.7734 MHz) are passed through untouched
- 0.62: added SAA1099, YM2413, SN76489 support and the "PLUG" plugin header (by azesmbog)
- 0.61: YM2203 / 2x YM2203 (TSFM) support
